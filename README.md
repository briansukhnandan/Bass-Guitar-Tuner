# Bass Guitar Tuner #
- Decided to build a bass guitar tuner as I had always used one online, and found myself in a predicament where I was on vacation and needed to tune my guitar, but the cruise ship didn't have internet! 
- I didn't let that stop me from tuning my bass guitar and getting to playing! 
- The actual program itself is made with tkinter and replays sounds that I recorded via a USB Guitar cable and Audacity.
